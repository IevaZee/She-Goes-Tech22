# So today's exercise: #
# Write a program that asks for and saves a username
# Ask a question about the user's age, using the username in the question.
# Shows in how many years the user will be 100 years old smile
# BONUS: 
# then you will need two additional lines:
# import datetime # let's talk about imports separately
# currentYear = datetime.datetime.now (). yearLet the program also show the year when the user will be 100 years old.
# It could use a variable with the current year.
# It would be even better to get the current year automatically
